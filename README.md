# Project_UPSCALE
The UPSCALE project focuses on developing a workflow for a 3D-printed chiral lattice metamaterial with rigid inclusions.

# UPSCALE – Chiral Lattice Metamaterials with Rigid Inclusions

This repository contains 3D models and supplementary files from the UPSCALE project, a 3-year research initiative focusing on the development of chiral lattice metamaterials with rigid inclusions. These structures are designed to exhibit unique mechanical properties, such as coupling between axial compression and rotational motion, enabled by the chiral arrangement of struts.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes the following files:

- `2D_LatticeCell_v1.stl` – The first iteration of the 2D lattice cell design.  
- `DIC_Stencil_v1.stl` – A stencil for Digital Image Correlation (DIC) experiments, enabling consistent speckle patterns during testing.  

Future versions will include updated lattice designs and additional experimental resources.

## About the UPSCALE Project

**UPSCALE** is a research project focusing on:
- Developing chiral lattice metamaterials with locally buckling struts and rigid inclusions
- Exploring structural detailing using Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing (MEX AM)
- Investigating mechanical responses under compression, including twist-like deformations
